# Yet-Another-BRSAR-Patcher
'Cause there weren't enough already.
Made specifically with Skyward Sword in mind, as its BRSARs don't have extensions - most of the patchers out there assume there is one.

Put the BRSAR file and all the BRSTMS into one folder. The BRSTMs need to be named as they are in the original filesystem. 
Run the program to automatically change the filesize in the BRSAR. 

You can run the program in a terminal to see output.
BRSAR is resaved as [original filename]_out
